# Retail-Analysis-Dashboard
This project covers a real-world messy retail dataset from two different years with 1,730 rows. It includes issues such as missing values, duplicates, and typos. The aim of this project is to demonstrate data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. Also, to track the progress of sales/profit across both years.
